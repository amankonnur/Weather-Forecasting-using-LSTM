# Weather Forecasting using LSTM

This project utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for weather forecasting with enhanced accuracy compared to traditional models.
It leverages various meteorological parameters to predict future weather trends.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Model (LSTM)**: Achieves greater forecasting accuracy compared to conventional models.
- **Meteorological Data**: Uses multiple weather parameters for better forecasting.
- **Improved Forecasting**: Addresses the challenges posed by climate change with high-precision predictions.
- **Web Application**: User-friendly interface for forecasting weather.
- **Accuracy**: Achieved 92% accuracy in predicting weather patterns.

## Project Highlights
